# Mobile Wrapper (Capacitor)

This optional package wraps the desktop/web UI into Android.

## One-command Android build

```bash
./scripts/build_android.sh
```

The script initializes dependencies, syncs Capacitor, and builds an unsigned debug APK.

For signed release APK/AAB, configure keystore in Android Studio and run a release build.
